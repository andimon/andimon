# Widen my programming lanugage stack

Lately, I've been involved in working with a programming language called Elixir. It is an awesome, growing functional language that lets you build scalable and maintainable applications. I believe that many organizations could benefit if they adopt this language because it allows you to ship applications faster, giving organizations more time to focus on business logic instead.

However, the market still relies on other popular languages such as C#, Java, Python, C++, ...

I need to invest more time getting familiar with other languages in the market. 

In order to improve the familiarity with other programming languages I've taken a set of challanges that were given to us at university and had to write microservices in which we had to implement using [spring](https://spring.io/).

need consultancy services. There are three types of consultants: (1) senior consultants; (2) executive

want but they take 5%, 10% and 15% commission from each type of consultant respectively.
